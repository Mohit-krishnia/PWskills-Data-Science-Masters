    "'''Q.1 Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening.\n",
    "Ans- The open() function is used to open a file in Python. It takes two parameters: the file name (including the path if it is not in the current \n",
    "        directory) and the mode in which to open the file.\n",
    "        There are several modes in which a file can be opened:\n",
    "        a) r - Read mode: This is the default mode. It opens a file for reading. If the file does not exist, it raises an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "        b) w - Write mode: This mode opens a file for writing. If the file already exists, it truncates (clears) the file content. If the file does not exist\n",
